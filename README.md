## 🚀 About Me

You see, I am rather passionate with talking about modding and it always baffles me how much people can push the limits of a game with mods. I aspire to be in a team of developers that can push the boundaries of what's possible and what's not.

I am a storywriter and a novice programmer, trying their best, out of their own passion while trying to bulldoze through my CS cirriculum with straight As. I make projects that makes me curious or looks cool, like bringing an AI's existence into other chatting platform like discord.

I also like to lobotomize AIs and curious to observe it's patterns and how it behaves under chaos. That is why I am also learning Machine Learning and then AI at some point.

Opportunities will arise when i see one, and i'll gladly take whatever to inflate my CV, so feel free to reach out to me, I still freelance :D
