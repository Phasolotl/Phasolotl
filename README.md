## ⭐ About Me

You see, I am rather passionate with talking about **modding** and it always baffles me how much people can push the **limits of a game** with mods. I aspire to be in a **team of developers** that can push the boundaries of what's possible and what's not.

I am a **storywriter** and a junior **programmer**, trying their best, out of their own passion while trying to bulldoze through my CS cirriculum with **straight As**. I make projects that makes me curious or looks cool, like bringing an AI's existence into other chatting platform like discord.

I also like to lobotomize **AIs** and curious to observe it's patterns and how it behaves under chaos. That is why I am also learning **Machine Learning** and then **AI** at some point.

Opportunities will arise when i see one, and i'll gladly take whatever to inflate my CV, so feel free to reach out to me, **I still freelance!**
